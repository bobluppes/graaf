# About

Graph is an abstract data type that is widely used in computer science. It is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges
that connect these vertices. Graphs are used to model many real-world problems, such as social networks, road networks,
and computer networks. As such, graph algorithms are used in many applications, including route planning, network
analysis, and data mining.

Graaf: A Lightweight, Header-Only C++20 Graph Library

**Key Features**:

- **Header-only**: No separate compilation or linking required.
- **Generality**: Supports user-defined vertex and edge classes.
- **Algorithm Support**: Provides a range of graph algorithms.

**Purpose**:
Graaf is designed with the goal of simplifying graph-related tasks. It offers a lightweight alternative to the [Boost Graph Library (BGL)](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html) and is built for simplicity and extensibility. With Graaf, you can easily create, manipulate, and analyze graphs, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

# Installation

The most straightforward way to use the Graaf in your project is to include it as a header-only library. Please take a
look at the [installation guide](https://bobluppes.github.io/graaf/docs/quickstart/installation) for alternative
installation methods.

## Header-Only Library

The Graaf libary can be included as a header-only library. All it requires is a compiler with **C++ 20 support**.

Download the `header-only` library from our [release page](https://github.com/bobluppes/graaf/releases) and add
the `include/graaflib` directory to your include path. You can now use Graaf in your source files:

```c++
// main.cpp
#include <graaflib/directed_graph>
```

For more details or alternative installation methods, see
the [installation guide](https://bobluppes.github.io/graaf/docs/quickstart/installation).

# How to use Graaf

Using the Graaf library is easy! Specializations are provided for a `directed_graph` as well as for `undirected_graph`.
To create your first graph:

```c++
undirected_graph<int, float> my_graph{};
```

This creates an undirected graph with `integer` values on the vertices and `float` weights on the edges. Graaf is
designed with generality in mind. As such, it can be used to store any user-defined vertex and edge class:

```c++
struct User {
  std::string name;
  int age;
};

// An edge type can also be unweighted if we don't derive from weighted_edge
struct Connection : public weighted_edge<float> {
  float strength;
  float get_weight() const override { return strength; }
};

undirected_graph<User, Connection> my_graph{};
```

Implementations for common [graph algorithms](#algorithms) are provided under the `algorithm` namespace. Combining this
with built-in `dot` format support allows us to do things like visualizing the shortest path between two vertices:
