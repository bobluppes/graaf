# About

Using the Graaf library is easy! Specializations are provided for a `directed_graph` as well as for `undirected_graph`.
To create your first graph:

```c++
undirected_graph<int, float> my_graph{};
```

This creates an undirected graph with `int`eger values on the vertices and `float` weights on the edges. Graaf is
designed with generality in mind. As such, it can be used to store any user-defined vertex and edge class:

```c++
struct User {
  std::string name;
  int age;
};

// An edge type can also be unweighted if we don't derive from weighted_edge
struct Connection : public weighted_edge<float> {
  float strength;
  float get_weight() const override { return strength; }
};

undirected_graph<User, Connection> my_graph{};
```

Implementations for common [graph algorithms](#algorithms) are provided under the `algorithm` namespace. Combining this
with built-in `dot` format support allows us to do things like visualizing the shortest path between two vertices:

To get started, take a look at our [quickstart guide](https://bobluppes.github.io/graaf/docs/quickstart/intro).

# Installation

The most straightforward way to use the Graaf in your project is to include it as a header-only library. Please take a
look at the [installation guide](https://bobluppes.github.io/graaf/docs/quickstart/installation) for alternative
installation methods.

## Header-Only Library

The Graaf libary can be included as a header-only library. All it requires is a compiler with C++ 20 support.

Download the `header-only` library from our [release page](https://github.com/bobluppes/graaf/releases) and add
the `include/graaflib` directory to your include path. You can now use Graaf in your source files:

```c++
// main.cpp
#include <graaflib/directed_graph>
```

For more details or alternative installation methods, see
the [installation guide](https://bobluppes.github.io/graaf/docs/quickstart/installation).
